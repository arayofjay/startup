# Notes
## Github Assignment
- Created [README.md](./README.md) and [conflictTest.md](./conflictTest.md)
- Learned how to push, pull, commit, merge, and other git commands using VSCode

### Useful Git commands
- `git commit -am`
- `git fetch`

## HTML
### HTML Questions
- When is it needed to close the `<d></d>` vs `<d blah blah>`?
   - the blah blah in the above line is an element but with ATTRIBUTES, and the attributes are what go before the first tag's close
- Do all hyperlinks have to be in an anchor element? Can we embed hyperlinks in other elements
- Difference between aside and section?

### HTML Learned
- href for hyperlinks
- `<br>` at the end of a line in a paragraph for a new line
- the `span` element will only take up as much space on the webpage that the content needs

## CSS
### CSS Questions
- couldn't figure out the padding in CSS practice for the sections

### CSS Learned
- Useful:
  - .class
  - #id
  - p[attribute='']
  - main:hover (or other commands)
- You can use `main *` to format everything within main (children, grandchildren, etc.)
- Use `main > *` to format only DIRECT children to main
  - You can also do things like `main > *:not(:last-child). This formats everything that are not the last-child

## JavaScript
### JS Questions
- Still don't really get promises. I mean I feel like I get how they function, but just not sure about the pizza thing
- I really don't get the await and async stuff. When do I use async?
